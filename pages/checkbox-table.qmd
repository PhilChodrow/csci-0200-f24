### Calculating Your Grade

You can use the table below to visualize your progress based on your quiz problems and the assignment feedback you've received. [This table doesn't take into account [penalties for missing warmups](#assessment-of-warmups).]{.aside}

**Instructions**: 

- Check off **Learning Targets** as you go, starting from the bottom. For example, once you've checked off 6 learning targets you have filled the "C" row, and once you've checked off 8 learning targets you have filled the "B" row. 
- Check off **Labs** as you get receive feedback. When you receive an assessmment on a lab, you can check off that lab **up to once in each grade tier**. For example, if you receive an **M**, you can check off one box for "M or E" in each of Tiers A, B, and C. If you receive an **E**, you can check off one box for **E** in Tiers A and B, and one box for **M or E** in Tier C. **R**'s can only be used to check off boxes in the second row of Tier C. 

Once *all* boxes in a row are checked, you have earned that grade in the course, *provided* that you have missed no more than 3 warmup activities.
