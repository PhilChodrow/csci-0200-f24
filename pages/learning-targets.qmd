[Targets **LS1-3** are introduced on Quiz 1. Targets **PF1**, **PF2**, and **FR1** are introduced on Quiz 2. Targets **C1**, **C2**, and **R1** are introduced on Quiz 3. Targets **G1**, **P1**, and **P2** are introduced on Quiz 4.]{.aside}
 
**Logic and Sets **

- **LS1**: I can simplify and evaluate logical expressions that include quantifiers and boolean operations. 
- **LS2**: I can represent sets in set-builder notation; determine whether an object is an element of a set; and prove that one set is equal to or a subset of another. 
- **LS3**: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, difference, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set. 

**Proofs **

- **PF1**: I can use direct proof, proof by cases, and proof-by-contradiction to prove mathematical statements. 
- **PF2**: I can choose between weak and strong induction and write correct inductive proofs that include both a base case and an inductive step. 

**Functions and Relations**

- **FR1**: I can determine whether or not a given relation is an equivalence relation. 


**Counting** 

- **C1**: I can use the principles of addition, multiplication, and inclusion-exclusion to solve counting problems. 
- **C2**: I can use permutations and combinations to count the number of candidate solutions to a given problem. 

**Recursion and Recurrence Relations**

- **R1**: I can use recurrence relations to model and analyze simple mathematical processes and algorithms. 


**Graphs**

- **G1**: I can write correct proofs of simple mathematical propositions about the structure of graphs. 

**Probability**

- **PR1**: I can evaluate marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities of events on discrete sample spaces. 
- **PR2**: I can evaluate expectations of random variables on discrete sample spaces.
