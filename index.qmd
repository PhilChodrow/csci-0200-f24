Welcome to CSCI 0200: Math Foundations of Computer Science! In this course, we'll learn to the fundamentals of mathematical reasoning about data structures and algorithms. We'll learn how to address questions like: 

- How many possibilities does a search algorithm need to weed through in order to find the best solution to a problem?
- How do we *know* that a certain algorithm works? How do we *know* how fast it is? 
- What role do uncertainty and randomness play in computation?
