### CS and Math Go Way Back

<br>

Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and author of the first published computer 
program (1840).

Her program was designed to compute an important sequence of mathematical constants on the "Difference Engine" designed by Charles Babbage.

Babbage never completed his Difference Engine, so Lovelace's program was never run.

Lovelace described her approach to math as "*poetical science*."

### CS and Math Go Way Back

<br>

Alan Turing was an English mathematician who played a major role in developing the theory of computer science and AI. 

Turing proved that some tasks are *impossible* for algorithms to perform, no matter how powerful or clever they are.  

The "Nobel Prize in Computer Science" is named the *Turing Award*. 

*Turing was chemically castrated as a punishment for homosexuality in 1953. The UK managed to apologize for this in...2009.*

### CS and Math Go Way Back

<br>

John von Neumann was a Hungarian mathematician who guided the development of the first digital computers. 

The "von Neumann architecture" remains the high-level architectural basis of the design of modern computers. 


*If you're wondering what the first digital computers were used for, watch Oppenheimer.* ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

- **Prep**: Videos and readings 
- **Warmups**: practice problems, graded on completion

##### In Class (1 hr)

- Questions
- Group work
- Activities
- Additional topics, demonstrations, etc. 

## 

### Friday Labs

- 7 total throughout the semester
- Start in class with assigned groups
- Finish as homework and submit a week later 

#### Assessment

Assessed as **Excellent (E)**, **Meets Expectations (M)**, **Needs Revision (R)**, or **Not Complete (N)**. You want **E**s and **M**s. 

#### Revision

**You can revise and resubmit** your labs after your first assessment in order to achieve a higher assessment. 

## 

### Quizzes

- 4 total, on Fridays
- Timed for 45 minutes (**contact me with DRC letters!!**)

#### Learning Targets

- We have 12 Learning Targets related to core course competencies. 
- You'll have multiple opportunities to complete each Learning Target, but **you only need to do it once**. 
- 3 targets are added on each quiz, but you only need to attempt ones you haven't already gotten.

## Support Resources

#### **Academic support**

- Student Hours are **your time**: come talk to me about anything! Mondays 2pm-4pm, Thursdays 3pm-4pm. 
- Evening Peer Help, hours TBD. 
- Our Assistant in Instruction Smith Gakuya holds Student Hours for CSCI 0200. 
- Online Q&A forum. 

#### **Clearing barriers to learning**

- The DRC can help you obtain a letter of accommodation for timed assessments. 
- **Legally, I need your letter in order to offer you accommodations.**

## Classroom Environment

<br> <br> 

Inclusion, access, and participation are **collective projects**. 

- Discrimination is unjust and it sucks. Don't do it. 
- Address people respectfully --- chosen names and pronouns. 
- Don't leave each other behind in group work. 
- Bragging about something being easy just makes the people around you feel bad.  
- Are you fast at the material? Cool. Use your ability to *support the learning* of the people around you. 

I am a **mandatory reporter** of potential incidents of sexual violence or harassment. There is a link to some confidential resources on the syllabus. 



## For Wednesday

<br> <br> 


#### [**Entrance Survey**]{.alert-2}: tell me about yourself and help me find your teammates for lab. 

#### [**Math autobiography**]{.alert-2}: your history as a learner and user of mathematics. 

*These assignments are on Canvas.*
