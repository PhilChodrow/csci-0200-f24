### Inverse, Converse, Contrapositive

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Define the following two propositions: 

- $p$: $a \in A$. 
- $q$: $a \in A \cap B$. 

Consider the logical expression $p \rightarrow q$. We have the: 

- **Inverse**: $\lnot p \rightarrow \lnot q$. 
- **Converse**: $q \rightarrow p$. 
- **Contrapositive**: $\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p$.

Write each of these out, replacing $p$ and $q$ with their definitions in terms of set memberships. 

- Determine which of the original, inverse, converse, and contrapositive statements are true [using Venn diagrams]{.alert-2}
- Determine which of these statements are true using what we know about [logical equivalences for inverse, converse, and contrapositive]{.alert-2}. You'll still need to know the truth value of the first statement -- you can do that one with Venn diagrams.
