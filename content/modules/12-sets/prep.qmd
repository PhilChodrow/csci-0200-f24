# Reading (30 mins)

- [DMOI 0.3](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html) 

 
## Optional Reading
 
*This is a slightly more advanced reading that may appeal to you if you want to see more theoretical math examples.*

- [BOP 1.1, 1.4-1.7](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/Main.pdf#page=15)
 
# Warmup Problems (~30 mins) 

*Please complete these problems "by hand," without typing. Pencil/pen and paper is best practice for the quiz, but using a stylus with a tablet is also fine. Then, scan/photograph or otherwise produce an image of your solutions and upload them to Canvas.*
