## Problem 1

{{< include ../../../content/problems/quantified-logic/dmoi-3-16.qmd >}}
 
*Note*: *this problem is the first two parts of 3.16 in [DMOI](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_propositional.html), and it has an online solution. I recommend that you try this problem on your own first, carefully **show all your steps**, and then check against the solution.*  

## Problem 2

### Note

*While completing one of the parts of this problem, you'll need to use a predicate with multiple arguments. Some examples:*

- $P(x, y)$: $x$ is the parent of $y$. 
- $Q(x, y, z)$: $x$, $y$, and $z$ are in a project group. 
- $R(x, y)$: $x$ is the number the results from multiplying $y$ by 3; that is, $x = 3y$.
