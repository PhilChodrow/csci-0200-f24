# Reading (~15 mins)

For the warmup, it's enough to review last time's reading, with special focus on the topic of *set cardinality*.

# Warmup Problems (~40 mins) 

*Please complete these problems "by hand," without typing. Pencil/pen and paper is best practice for the quiz, but using a stylus with a tablet is also fine. Then, scan/photograph or otherwise produce an image of your solutions and upload them to Canvas.*

## Problem 1

{{< include ../../../content/problems/sets/element-method-2.qmd >}}

**Hint**: Recall that your proof should begin with the phrase "Let $x\in A$" and end with a phrase similar to "Therefore, $x \in B$." 

**Hint**: You may find it helpful to recall the following property of logarithms. For any $a > 0$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$, $\log_2a^b = b\log_2a$.
