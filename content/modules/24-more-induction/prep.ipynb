        "You and your friend are playing the following (fun!) game. There are two piles of apples. The first player removes some positive integer number of apples from one of the piles. Then, the second player also removes some number of apples from one of the piles. Each player can remove any number of apples from *one* of the two piles, but cannot take apples from both piles simultaneously. \n",

        "The players alternate until one of them removes the very last apple (from either pile). That player, who removes the very last apple, wins. \n",
        "\n",
        "You deviously encourage your friend to go first. Then, you use a simple copycat strategy: whenever your friend removes $j$ apples from one pile, you always remove the same number $j$ apples from the second pile. \n",

        "Prove the following statement using strong induction: \n",

        "**Base case**: suppose that $n=1$. Then, your friend (the first player) must remove an apple from one of the piles. You remove the other apple from the other pile. This is the last apple, so you win! \n",
        "\n",
        "**Strong inductive step**: suppose that the statement is true for all $n \\leq k$. We'll show that this implies that the statement is true for $n = k+1$. The first player must remove some number of apples (let's say $j$) from one of the piles. You then use your copycat strategy to remove $j$ apples from the other pile. Each pile now contains $k-j+1$ apples. Now it's as though we're beginning a new game with each pile containing $k - j + 1$ apples. But since $j\\geq 1$, $k-j+1 \\leq k$, so your copycat strategy will win in this new game too. This completes the strong inductive step. Therefore, your copycat strategy always wins.  \n",
