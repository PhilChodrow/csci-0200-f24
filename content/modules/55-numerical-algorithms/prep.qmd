# Introduction

In today's lab, we are going to use recurrence relations to analyze a *numerical algorithm*. Numerical algorithms are used for solving problems in computational mathematics. For example, your computer doesn't naturally "just know" how to compute things like $\sin{x}$, $\sqrt{x}$, or $\log x$ -- people need to write *algorithms* for computing these quantities. Making these algorithms reliable and fast is one of the priorities of the field called *numerical analysis*, which sits at the intersection of mathematics and computer science.
