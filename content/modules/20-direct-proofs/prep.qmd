## Warmup (~40 minutes)

## Problem 1

*These are the problems at the end of Dobson + Slomson in the reading*

**Hint**: *The video [Proving that Divisibility is Transitive](https://youtu.be/F78_7Lv-7vM?si=0RlFPAo2GU4ANNGp) (11:08) is not required for today but you might find it very helpful with one of the warmup problems.*
